## General info
This project was designed to show off my skills developing with Bootstrap. Thusfar, it has been my most intensive Bootstrap undertaking. I have learned quite a bit since this project began. It's been very satisfying to see things I've been working so hard on come to life. I was sure to add any cool stuff I learned along the way to my <a href="https://codepen.io/amyscotteng">Codepen</a> so be sure to head on over and check that out! I hope my little Pens can help someone else out. :)
